In recent years, one of the biggest applications of machine learning has been in image classification — the ability for a computer to intelligently recognize an object. Such work is being done at the greatest technology companies, and it’s since spawned this unwarranted notion of exclusivity. We’ve crafted a narrative that in order to get your hands dirty with machine learning and artificial intelligence, you have to be some sort of certifiable genius, or at least an engineering graduate just to break in. I think that’s bullshit, so I’m going to to show you how in less than 10 minutes, you can build a fully-functioning image classifier that can recognize any (yes, any) object with insanely high probabilities.
